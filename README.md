#  Brain-Stoke-Prediction

### Problem Statement

 In recent years strokes are one of the leading causes of death by affecting the central nervous system. Among different types of strokes, ischemic and hemorrhagic majorly damages the central nervous system. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), globally 3% of the population are affected by subarachnoid hemorrhage, 10% with intracerebral hemorrhage, and the majority of 87% with ischemic stroke. In this  work, Machine Learning techniques are applied in identifying, classifying, and predicting the stroke from medical information. This work of the Stroke Predictor (SPR) model using machine learning techniques improved the prediction accuracy to 99% when compared with the existing models.
